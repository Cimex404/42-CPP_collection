One day, Alice and her best friend Bob decided to explore the old forest behind their village.
They had always heard stories about a hidden treasure buried deep inside, but no one had ever found it.

As they walked past the tall trees, Bob noticed something strange—a small map stuck under a rock.
'Look at this, Alice!' he exclaimed. The map showed a path leading to a cave near the river.

Excited, they followed the directions, crossing a narrow bridge and climbing over fallen logs.
Finally, they reached the cave. Inside, they found an old chest covered in dust. With trembling hands,
Alice opened it, and inside was a pile of shiny gold coins.

'We found the treasure!' shouted Bob. But as soon as they touched the coins, the ground started to shake,
and a deep voice echoed through the cave:
'Those who take must also give...'

Terrified but determined, Alice and Bob decided to leave behind something valuable of their own—a silver
pendant that Alice had worn since childhood. As soon as they placed it inside, the cave stopped shaking.

Smiling at each other, they knew they had solved the mystery of the forest.
